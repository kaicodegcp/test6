Standardized SWIDTAG Creation for Citiconda Using Ansible Automation
Description
Strengthening Software Asset Management and Compliance:
The EAP Strategic Solutions team developed and committed an Ansible automation (cti_rhel_eapbigdata_bdeng_vm_maintenance_Citiconda_swidtag.yml) to streamline the deployment of SWIDTAGs for Citiconda software across Citi-managed Linux nodes. This automation supports both Citiconda39 (Python 3.9) and Citiconda3 (Python 3.7) installations across application servers and Cloudera CDP cluster nodes.

By integrating SWIDTAG creation into the automation framework, this effort enhances software identification, asset tracking, and licensing compliance across SDLC environments.

Key Achievements:
Developed an Ansible playbook that identifies OS versions and dynamically includes SWIDTAG parcel variables for RHEL7 and RHEL8.

Deployed SWIDTAGs for Citiconda39 and Citiconda3 across both application and Cloudera-managed hosts.

Integrated the Citiconda role to support scalable and reusable tagging operations.

Benefits to the Team:
Improves visibility of installed software packages through automated tagging.

Enables software compliance tracking aligned with Citi governance policies.

Reduces manual efforts for SWIDTAG generation and deployment across environments.

Provides a reusable automation framework for future tagging requirements.

Next Steps:
Expand the Ansible role to support SWIDTAGs for additional EAP-managed software components.

Integrate this SWIDTAG deployment into VM provisioning pipelines.

Validate automation across edge cases (e.g., minimal OS versions, custom Python installs).
