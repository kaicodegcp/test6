Automated Docker Installation for EAP OpenShift Pre-Requisite Setup via Ansible
Description

Accelerating OpenShift Onboarding with Automation:
The EAP Strategic Solutions team successfully implemented Ansible-based automation to handle Docker installation from Citi’s internal Artifact Repository. This playbook, named cti_rhel_eapbigdata_bdeng_openshift_automation_deploy_eap_docker.yml, streamlines the setup of Docker and its dependencies across all SDLC environments—eliminating the need for manual steps or public YUM repositories.

The automation ensures consistent and repeatable Docker setup on the CM Admin host and supporting nodes during Cloudera CDS installations on OpenShift, aligning with Citi's SDLC standards and security posture.

Key Achievements:

Developed a reusable Ansible playbook to install Docker, Docker CLI, Compose, Buildx, and containerd.io using RPMs from a secure artifact repo.

Designed parameterized input for repo URLs and credentials, improving security and adaptability.

Enabled hands-free deployment of Docker across multiple hosts and environments in one execution.

Integrated automation with CDS OpenShift documentation for reference and reusability.

Benefits to the Team:

Accelerates OpenShift CDS pre-requisite setup by avoiding manual Docker configuration.

Ensures consistency across CM Admin, worker nodes, and staging/prod clusters.

Reduces risk of repo access issues by using pre-fetched artifact-based RPMs.

Aligns with Citi’s secure software delivery practices and compliance mandates.

Next Steps:

Extend automation to support RHEL9+ Docker RPM variations if applicable.

Integrate with CDS installation pipelines for end-to-end provisioning.

Publish this role for cross-team reuse within Citi OpenShift enablement.
